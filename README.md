This is a monorepo for the **Dogschool Hope** project. It includes:

- **Web**: React app
- **API**: NestJS backend
- **Mobile**: React Native app
- **Shared**: Reusable logic, types, and utilities

Built with [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo) for high-performance monorepo management.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### 2. Start the apps

In the root folder:

```bash
Get started by editing apps/web/app/page.tsx
```

This will run `web`, `api`, and `mobile` in parallel using `turbo`.

## ðŸ“¦ Individual App Commands

You can also run each app separately:

### Web

```bash
cd apps/web
yarn dev
```

### API

```bash
cd apps/api
yarn start:dev
```

> Make sure you have a `.env` file configured in `apps/api/`.

### Mobile

```bash
cd apps/mobile
yarn start
```

> You can also use `npx expo start` if using Expo.

## ðŸ§ª Tests (Coming Soon)

Each app and package will have its own test configuration using tools like:

- **Jest**
- **React Testing Library**
- **Supertest** for API
